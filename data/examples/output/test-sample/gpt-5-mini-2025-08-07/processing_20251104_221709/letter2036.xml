        <p>Sir</p>
        <p>The opportunity offered me by the voyage of a friend Mr Robert Wilson to Malta and his probable passage through Vienna on his return to England promises with the most favourable one I could procure of continuing at this distant interval the correspondence with Vienna which it is the desire of every friend to oriental literature in Calcutta to maintain – you will I hope have received the parcels sent you from this sometime or from years ago and which I was sorry to find by your letter to my friend Captain Lockett had got no farther than Trieste after having been so long dispatched. You will probably also have received by this time the twelfth volume of the Asiatic Researches which Mr Colebrooke at present acting as agent to the Society in London has been directed to forward to your address. I hope soon to have the thirteenth volume to send to you by the same channel.</p>
        <p>We have received your books and are obliged to you for such proofs of your regard. The Mines of the East seem to be the depositaries of much oriental wealth and must be highly serviceable to the cultivation of Asiatic literature. I apprehend some error has been made in their assortment however as the numbers received from three volumes compleat whilst we want two numbers of the fourth and have only the first volume of the fifth. I have not at present the means of ascertaining the numbers of the fourths which are deficient but shall take an early opportunity of writing to you again and will then be more exact in my account – your own works on the Topography etc. of the Levante and Statistical account of the Ottoman Empire have all come safe and sound.</p>
        <p>I have little news to give to you. Oriental study is rather languishing amongst us and we stand in need of some sent spur as the emulation which your labours and those of Monr Langles or De Sacy etc? are calculated to excite. The Persian Dictionary the Burhan Katā will very shortly issue from the Press edited by Captain Roebuck and I trust to get clear of my Sanscrit Dictionary be the end of this year – as soon as completed I shall request your acceptance of a copy till when accept the assurances of my highest esteem and believe me for faithful and obedient</p>
