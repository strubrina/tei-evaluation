<body>
  <div type="letter">
    <date>Wien den 4. November 809</date>
    <p>
      <salute>Euer Wohlgeboren</salute>
      gefälliges, Schreiben vom 2. v M hätte ich gerne auf der Stelle beantwortet. Der Anschein einer Hoffnung, selbst eine Reise nach Paris machen zu können, bewog mich, meine Antwort von Tag zu Tag zu verschieben. Da dieser Anschein nun gänzlich verschwunden, so bitte ich Sie um so dringender um die baldigste Beförderung meines französischen Mspts zum Drucke, als dasselbe sonst wirklich durch die frühere Erscheinung einer anderen Übersetzung den größten Teil seines Werts, nämlich der gänzlichen Neuheit verlieren könnte.
    </p>
    <p>
      Die Durchführung des französischen Styles, der wohl hie und da einiger Zurechtweisung, aber nichts weniger als einer Umarbeitung bedarf, scheint mir auf eine so einfache Weise ins Werk gesetzt werden zu können, daß ich mich wirklich wundere, daß Euer Wohlgeboren dasselbe nicht auf diesem Wege, wenn sich kein anderer darbot, bewerkstelligt haben. Alle französischen Blätter waren ja noch unlängst von der Ankündigung eines bureau de correspondence litteraire voll, wo man sich namentlich zur Durchsehung und Verbesserung von Mskpten gegen sehr billige Bedingnisse anbot. Mir scheint es also wohl das einfachste, das Sie die 50 Spalten der Übersetzung sogleich nach Paris senden, durch Ihren dortigen Korrespondenten mit dem bureau über die Bedingnisse der Verbesserung grammatikalischer Unrichtigkeiten übereinkommen, und den dafür bestimmten Betrag mir vom Honorarium abziehen. Es versteht sich, daß diese Übereinkunft nur durch Einsicht des Mskpts selbst getroffen werden kann. Es darf sich aber nur von der Verbesserung von Sprachunrichtigkeiten, nicht aber etwa von der Umarbeitung der ganzen Übersetzung handeln, aus der sonst statt einer treuen Übersetzung, was sie ist, eine französische Travestierung werden könnte
    </p>
    <p>
      Ich glaube, Euer Wohlgeboren werden keine Schwierigkeit finden, die so sehnlich erwartete Ausgabe des französischen Textes, ohne welchen der deutsche keineswegs erscheinen darf, zu befördern, und werden mich sehr verbinden, wenn Sie die Güte haben wollen, von dem hierin Geschehenem zu verständigen Ihren mit vollkommenster Hochachtung verharrenden ergebensten Diener
    </p>

RAW LLM RESPONSE:
<think>
Okay, let's start encoding this letter. First, I need to follow the given rules. The root element is <body>, and inside that, a <div type="letter"> for the main letter parts. The address is in a separate <div type="address">, but according to the rules, the address is handled as a separate element. Wait, the user said except for salutation and address, so maybe the address is in its own div.

Looking at the letter, the first line is the dateline: "Calcutta Jany 24.1818". That should be in a <date> element inside a <dateline> within the <div type="letter">. 

Next is the salutation: "Sir". The rules mention that p elements can contain a <salute> if the salutation is within a paragraph. But the example shows the salutation as a separate element. Wait, the exception says that p can have salute if embedded. However, in this case, the salutation is on a new line. The user said to maintain original paragraph sectioning and only mark new line beginnings in salutations. Hmm, maybe the salutation is part of the first paragraph. But according to the encoding rules, the salutation isn't being marked as per standard TEI, so perhaps it's left as a normal paragraph. Wait, the user said to not encode salutations and addresses as per standard TEI, but the examples might help.

Wait, the user says: "except the salutation and the address rule". So maybe the salutation is not marked with a specific element, but just part of the text. But the example in the initial problem might have used <salute> for salutations. However, the user's encoding rules state that for salutations, the standard TEI model is not followed. So perhaps the salutation is just a regular paragraph. But the first line after the dateline is "Sir" which is the salutation. So maybe that's a <salute> inside a <p> element. Wait, the first exception says that p elements may contain a salute when embedded. So maybe the first paragraph starts with "Sir" as a salute. Let me check the example again. The user provided an example where the salutation was in a <p> with a <salute> element. But since the user says to not follow standard TEI for salutations, maybe the salute is not marked. But the initial instruction says to encode all structural blocks except salutation and address. Wait, the task says: "encode all structural letter blocks with appropriate and valid TEI markup (except the salutation and the address rule)". So salutation and address are exceptions. Therefore, the salutation is not marked with any specific element, just part of the text. But the address is handled as a separate <div type="address">. Wait, the user's encoding rules say that div elements may contain an address without being in an ab element. So perhaps the address is a separate <div type="address">. But in this letter, the address is not present. The letter starts with the dateline, then salutation. So the address is not here. So the main letter is in the <div type="letter">.

So the structure would be:

<body>
  <div type="letter">
    <dateline>
      <date>Calcutta Jany 24.1818</date>
    </dateline>
    <p>Sir</p>
    <p>The opportunity offered me by the voyage... etc.</p>
    ...
    <p>believe me for faithful and obedient</p>
    <sig>HHWilson</sig>
    <note>Secr Asiatic</note>
  </div>
</body>

Wait, the signature is "HHWilson" and then "Secr Asiatic" which might be a note or part of the signature. So maybe the <sig> element for the name, and a <note> for the title. Also, there's a postscript? The letter ends with "believe me for faithful and obedient" which seems like the closing. The "Secr Asiatic" is likely a note or part of the signature. Let me check the original text again.

The original text ends with:

"believe me for faithful and obedient

HHWilson
Secr Asiatic"

So the signature is "HHWilson" and "Secr Asiatic" is a note. So in TEI, the <sig> would be "HHWilson" and then a <note> for "Secr Asiatic".

Also, the postscript: the user's example didn't have a postscript, but the original letter here doesn't have a separate postscript. So the main content is in the paragraphs.

Now, the paragraphs: the text is divided into paragraphs. The first paragraph after the salutation starts with "The opportunity..." and continues. Then there's a paragraph about receiving the books, then another about news, then the closing.

I need to ensure that the original paragraph breaks are preserved. The user says to maintain original paragraph sectioning. So each paragraph in the text is a <p> element.

Also, the date is in the first line, which is the dateline. So the <dateline> element with a <date> inside.

Now, checking for any addresses. The user's example might have had an address, but in this letter, there's no address provided. The letter starts with the dateline, salutation, etc. So no <div type="address"> here.

Also, maintaining original spelling and orthography. For example, "Jany" is used instead of "January", "Oriental" with a capital O, etc. All kept as is.

Now, the TEI structure:

- <body> as root
- Inside <div type="letter">
  - <dateline>
    - <date>Calcutta Jany 24.1818</date>
  - Then the salutation "Sir" as a <p>
  - Then the paragraphs
  - The signature <sig>HHWilson</sig>
  - A <note>Secr Asiatic</note> if needed, or part of the signature.

Wait, in TEI, the <sig> element is used for the signature. So "HHWilson" is the signature, and "Secr Asiatic" is a note or a title. So perhaps:

<sig>HHWilson</sig>
<note>Secr Asiatic</note>

But sometimes, the title might be part of the signature. Alternatively, if "Secr Asiatic" is part of the signature, it can be included in the <sig> element. But in the original text, it's on a new line. So maybe:

<sig>
  HHWilson<br/>
  Secr Asiatic
</sig>

But the user's rules say to maintain original paragraph sectioning, but not to mark new lines except in salutations. Wait, the user said: "Maintain original paragraph sectioning. Only mark new line beginnings in salutations". So, in the signature, if there's a new line, it's marked with <br/>. However, the user's example might have handled this. But in the original text, the signature is:

HHWilson
Secr Asiatic

So two lines. So in TEI, that would be:

<sig>
  HHWilson<br/>
  Secr Asiatic
</sig>

But the user's rules say to only mark new line beginnings in salutations. Wait, the salutation is "Sir" which is on a new line. The user said to mark new line beginnings in salutations, but in the rest of the text, maintain original paragraph sectioning. So the signature's line breaks would be marked with <br/> if they are new lines. However, the original instruction says to maintain original paragraph sectioning. So perhaps the line breaks in the signature are not marked, but kept as is. However, the user's example might have used <br/> for line breaks in the signature. But since the user hasn't provided an example, I need to follow the rules strictly.

The rules say: "Maintain original paragraph sectioning. Only mark new line beginnings in salutations". So for the salutation, new line beginnings are marked. For other parts, original paragraph sectioning is maintained. So in the main content, paragraphs are separated by <p> elements. The signature's line breaks would be considered as paragraph breaks? Or as line breaks. But the signature is a single paragraph. However, the original text has two lines. So perhaps the <sig> element would contain two <p> elements? Or use <br/>.

But TEI uses <br/> for line breaks within a paragraph. So the signature would be:

<sig>HHWilson<br/>Secr Asiatic</sig>

But the user's rules don't specify handling of line breaks in the signature. However, since the salutation is the only place where new line beginnings are marked, perhaps the signature's line breaks are not marked. But that would not be accurate. Alternatively, the entire signature is a single paragraph. However, in the original text, it's two lines. So to represent that, <br/> is needed. But the user's instruction says to only mark new line beginnings in salutations. So maybe not. But the salutation is "Sir" which is on a new line after the dateline. So the user's instruction is to mark new line beginnings in salutations. For other parts, maintain original paragraph sectioning. So the main content is divided into paragraphs, and line breaks within paragraphs (like in the signature) are not marked. But that might not be accurate. This is a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, since the user says to maintain original paragraph sectioning, perhaps the signature is considered a single paragraph, even if it's split into two lines. However, in TEI, line breaks within a paragraph are usually marked with <lb/>. But the user's rules don't mention that. The user says to maintain original paragraph sectioning, which would mean that each paragraph is a <p> element, and line breaks within paragraphs are not marked. So the signature's two lines would be part of the same <p> or <sig> element, but without <br/>. However, this might not be accurate. Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with using <br/> for line breaks in the signature, as it's a common practice in TEI to represent line breaks with <lb> or <br/>. But the user's rules don't mention that, so perhaps it's better to not include them. However, the original text has a line break between the signature and the note. Wait, the original text has:

believe me for faithful and obedient

HHWilson
Secr Asiatic

So after the closing line, there's a line break, then the signature. So the closing paragraph is "believe me for faithful and obedient", then the signature is on the next line. So the closing paragraph is one <p>, then the signature is a <sig> element. But the user's rules say that the salutation is handled with new line beginnings marked. But the signature is not a salutation. So the line break between the closing paragraph and the signature is not marked. Therefore, the structure would be:

<p>believe me for faithful and obedient</p>
<sig>HHWilson</sig>
<note>Secr Asiatic</note>

But "Secr Asiatic" is likely part of the signature. Maybe it's part of the <sig> element. So:

<sig>HHWilson<br/>Secr Asiatic</sig>

But again, the user's rules don't specify handling line breaks in the signature. Given the uncertainty, I'll proceed with using <br/> for the line break in the signature, as it's a common way to represent it in TEI.

Now, the <note> element for "Secr Asiatic" might not be necessary. It could be part of the <sig>. So:

<sig>HHWilson<br/>Secr Asiatic</sig>

That seems more accurate.

Now, the other parts: the paragraphs. The first paragraph after the salutation is the long paragraph starting with "The opportunity..." which includes the mention of the parcels and the volumes. Then a new paragraph about receiving the books and the Mines of the East. Then another paragraph about news and the Persian Dictionary. Then the closing paragraph.

Each of these is a <p> element. The user says to maintain original paragraph sectioning, so each paragraph in the original text is a separate <p>.

Also, check for any other elements. The user mentioned that the address is in a separate <div type="address">, but there's no address in this letter. So that's not needed here.

Now, putting it all together:

<body>
  <div type="letter">
    <dateline>
      <date>Calcutta Jany 24.1818</date>
    </dateline>
    <p>Sir</p>
    <p>The opportunity offered me by the voyage of a friend Mr Robert Wilson to Malta and his probable passage through Vienna on his return to England promises with the most favourable one I could procure of continuing at this distant interval the correspondence with Vienna which it is the desire of every friend to oriental literature in Calcutta to maintain – you will I hope have received the parcels sent you from this sometime or from years ago and which I was sorry to find by your letter to my friend Captain Lockett had got no farther than Trieste after having been so long dispatched. You will probably also have received by this time the twelfth volume of the Asiatic Researches which Mr Colebrooke at present acting as agent to the Society in London has been directed to forward to your address. I hope soon to have the thirteenth volume to send to you by the same channel.</p>
    <p>We have received your books and are obliged to you for such proofs of your regard. The Mines of the East seem to be the depositaries of much oriental wealth and must be highly serviceable to the cultivation of Asiatic literature. I apprehend some error has been made in their assortment however as the numbers received from three volumes compleat whilst we want two numbers of the fourth and have only the first volume of the fifth. I have not at present the means of ascertaining the numbers of the fourths which are deficient but shall take an early opportunity of writing to you again and will then be more exact in my account – your own works on the Topography etc. of the Levante and Statistical account of the Ottoman Empire have all come safe and sound.</p>
    <p>I have little news to give to you. Oriental study is rather languishing amongst us and we stand in need of some sent spur as the emulation which your labours and those of Monr Langles or De Sacy etc? are calculated to excite. The Persian Dictionary the Burhan Katā will very shortly issue from the Press edited by Captain Roebuck and I trust to get clear of my Sanscrit Dictionary be the end of this year – as soon as completed I shall request your acceptance of a copy till when accept the assurances of my highest esteem and believe me for faithful and obedient</p>
    <sig>HHWilson<br/>Secr Asiatic</sig>
  </div>
</body>

Wait, the last paragraph ends with "believe me for faithful and obedient", and then the signature. So the closing line is in the last <p> element. Then the <sig> comes after. That seems correct.

Also, check for any special characters, like the en dash in "– you will I hope..." and the em dash in "– as soon as completed...". These are preserved as is.

The name "De Sacy" has a non-breaking space, which should be preserved. In XML, spaces are typically represented as &nbsp; but since the user says to preserve original characters, it's kept as is.

The word "Sanscrit" is spelled that way, which is correct for the time period.

Now, ensuring that all elements are properly closed and nested. The <div type="letter"> contains the dateline, paragraphs, and sig. The <body> is the root.

This should meet the user's requirements.

RAW LLM RESPONSE:
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this TEI encoding task. The user provided a letter from Hartig to someone else, and they want it encoded according to the given rules. First, I need to make sure I understand the encoding rules properly.

The main points from the rules are: maintain original spelling and orthography, preserve paragraph structure, use the appropriate TEI elements, and follow the exceptions for salutations and addresses. The root element is <body>, and within it, a <div type="letter"> containing the letter's parts like dateline, salutation, content, signature, and postscript. Also, there's an <address> element for addresses, which can be directly under a <div> without being in an <ab>.

Looking at the provided letter text, the salutation starts with "Wohlgeborner Herr! Hochgeehrtester Herr Hofrat! Wertester Freund!" These are the three salutations. According to the exception rule, if the salutation is within a paragraph, it can be enclosed in a <salute> element inside a <p>. But the user mentioned that the salutation and address rules are exceptions, so I need to handle them carefully. However, the user said to encode all structural blocks except salutation and address. Wait, the task says to encode all structural letter blocks except the salutation and address. Wait, the user's instruction says: "Review the provided encoding rules - Analyze the letter structure and encode all structural letter blocks with appropriate and valid TEI markup (except the salutation and the address rule)".

Wait, the user says to encode all structural blocks except salutation and address. So, maybe the salutation and address are excluded from the encoding. But the example in the rules shows that the salutation can be in a <salute> inside a <p> if embedded. But the user says to exclude salutation and address. Wait, the user's task says: "encode all structural letter blocks with appropriate and valid TEI markup (except the salutation and the address rule)". So, perhaps the salutation and address are not to be encoded with their specific elements, but the rest of the structure is to be encoded normally. Wait, but the rules have exceptions for salutation and address. Let me check again.

In the encoding rules, under the "Exception from TEI valid encoding" section, there are two exceptions. The first allows p elements to contain a salute when the salutation is embedded in a paragraph. The second allows div elements to contain an address without being nested in an ab. However, the user's task says to encode all structural blocks except the salutation and address. Wait, that's conflicting. Let me re-read the user's instruction.

The user wrote: "Analyze the letter structure and encode all structural letter blocks with appropriate and valid TEI markup (except the salutation and the address rule)". So, they want to encode all structural parts except the salutation and address. That means, the salutation and address are not to be encoded with their specific elements (like <salute> or <address>), but the rest of the structure (dateline, content, signature, postscript) should be encoded with appropriate TEI elements.

But the example in the rules shows that for salutations, if they are embedded in a paragraph, they can be in a <salute> inside a <p>. However, the user is excluding salutation and address from encoding. Wait, maybe the user is saying that the salutation and address are not to be encoded with their own elements, but the rest of the structure is to be encoded. So, the salutation is just part of the text, not marked with <salute>, and the address is not marked with <address>, but the rest is encoded.

But the original rules have exceptions for salutation and address. However, the user's task says to exclude them from encoding. So perhaps the user wants that the salutation and address are not marked with their own elements, but the rest of the letter's structure is encoded normally.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "except the salutation and the address rule". Maybe that means that the user does not want to apply the salutation and address rules (i.e., the exceptions), and instead encode the salutation and address as regular text. But that's a bit confusing. Let me check the original task again.

The task says: "Review the provided encoding rules - Analyze the letter structure and encode all structural letter blocks with appropriate and valid TEI markup (except the salutation and the address rule)".

So, the user is telling to encode all structural blocks except the salutation and address. Therefore, the salutation and address are not to be encoded with their specific elements. However, the rest of the structure (dateline, content, signature, postscript) are to be encoded with appropriate TEI elements.

But the original rules do have exceptions for salutation and address. However, the user is excluding those from encoding. Therefore, the salutation is just part of the text within a paragraph, and the address is not marked with <address>, but perhaps as a regular <p> or something else.

Wait, the example in the rules shows that for salutations, if embedded in a paragraph, they can be in a <salute> inside a <p>. But the user's task says to exclude salutation and address from encoding. So, perhaps the salutation is not marked with <salute>, but just as part of the text. Similarly, the address is not marked with <address> but as regular text.

But the user's example in the rules shows that the address is allowed to be under a <div> without being in an <ab>. However, the user's task says to exclude the address from encoding. So maybe the address is not to be marked with <address>, but the rest is encoded.

This is a bit confusing. Let me proceed step by step.

First, the letter has a salutation: "Wohlgeborner Herr! Hochgeehrtester Herr Hofrat! Wertester Freund!" These are the salutations. According to the encoding rules, if they are embedded in a paragraph, they can be in a <salute> inside a <p>. However, the user's task says to exclude salutation and address from encoding. Therefore, perhaps these salutations are just part of the text, not marked with <salute>.

Then, the main body of the letter. The letter has several paragraphs. Each paragraph is to be marked with <p> elements. The user says to maintain original paragraph sectioning. The salutation is in the beginning, but according to the task, we are to exclude salutation and address. So, the salutation is part of the first paragraph, but not marked as a <salute>.

Then, the address is at the end: "Hartig / Graz am 22. Dez823". The user says to exclude the address from encoding, so this is just part of the text, not marked with <address>.

The rest of the structure: the main letter is within a <div type="letter">, which includes the dateline, content, signature, postscript. But the dateline is part of the letter structure. Wait, the dateline is usually part of the letter's metadata. However, in this case, the address is at the end, which might be the dateline. Wait, the line "Graz am 22. Dez823" is the date and place, so that's the dateline. But the user says to exclude the address from encoding. However, the dateline is different from the address. The address would be the sender's or recipient's address. In this letter, the address is not present; the line "Hartig / Graz am 22. Dez823" is the sender's name and the date, so that's the dateline, not the address. So perhaps the address is not present here, only the dateline.

Wait, the user's example might have different structures. Let me parse the given letter.

The letter starts with the salutation, then the body, then the signature, and then the dateline: "Hartig / Graz am 22. Dez823". So the structure is:

1. Salutation
2. Body (the main text)
3. Signature: "Euer Wohlgeboren ergebenster Freund"
4. Dateline: "Hartig / Graz am 22. Dez823"

In TEI, the structure is typically:

- <div type="letter">
  - <dateline>
  - <salute>
  - <body>
  - <signature>
  - <postscript>

But the user's task says to exclude salutation and address. Therefore, the <salute> and <address> elements are not to be used. So, the salutation is part of the body text, and the dateline is part of the letter structure, perhaps in a <dateline> element.

Wait, but the user's rules mention that the <address> can be directly under a <div> without being in an <ab>. However, in this case, the line "Hartig / Graz am 22. Dez823" is the dateline, not the address. The address would be the recipient's address, which isn't present here. So, the dateline is "Graz am 22. Dez823", and the sender's name is "Hartig".

In TEI, the <dateline> is used for the date and place, and the <signature> is the sender's name. So, perhaps the structure here is:

- <div type="letter">
  - <salute> (but user says to exclude salutation)
  - <body> containing the main text
  - <signature> Hartig
  - <dateline> Graz am 22. Dez823

But the user's task says to exclude salutation and address, so the <salute> is not used. So the salutation is part of the first paragraph.

Wait, but the user's instruction says to encode all structural blocks except salutation and address. So the salutation is not marked, but the rest is encoded. The main body is in <p> elements, the signature is in <signature>, the dateline is in <dateline>.

So, putting it together:

The root is <body>, then <div type="letter">.

Inside the <div type="letter">, the first part is the salutation, which is part of the first paragraph. Then the body text is divided into paragraphs. Then the signature, then the dateline.

Wait, but the user's rules mention that the <address> can be under a <div> without being in an <ab>, but the address is not present here. The dateline is part of the <div type="letter">.

So, the structure would be:

<body>
  <div type="letter">
    <p>Wohlgeborner Herr! Hochgeehrtester Herr Hofrat! Wertester Freund!</p>
    <p>Um Ihrem Wunsche zu entsprechen... (rest of the body text)</p>
    <signature>Hartig</signature>
    <dateline>Graz am 22. Dez823</dateline>
  </div>
</body>

But the user's example might have different elements. Also, the user mentioned that the <div type="letter"> includes the dateline, salutations, content, signature, and postscript. However, in this case, the salutation is part of the first paragraph, not marked as <salute>.

Wait, but the user's instruction says to exclude the salutation and address, so the salutation is not marked with <salute>, and the address is not marked with <address>. So, the salutation is just text within a <p>.

So, the first line is the salutation, which is part of the first paragraph. Then the rest of the letter is in <p> elements. The signature is <signature>, and the dateline is <dateline>.

But the user's example might not have the <dateline> element. Wait, in TEI, the <dateline> is part of the letter structure. So, in this case, the line "Graz am 22. Dez823" is the dateline, so it should be in a <dateline> element.

Therefore, the structure would be:

<body>
  <div type="letter">
    <p>Wohlgeborner Herr! Hochgeehrtester Herr Hofrat! Wertester Freund!</p>
    <p>Um Ihrem Wunsche zu entsprechen...</p>
    ...
    <signature>Hartig</signature>
    <dateline>Graz am 22. Dez823</dateline>
  </div>
</body>

But the user's instruction says to encode all structural blocks except salutation and address. So, the <salute> and <address> are excluded. Therefore, the salutation is part of the first paragraph, and the dateline is in a <dateline> element.

Now, the body of the letter has several paragraphs. Each paragraph should be marked with <p> elements, maintaining the original paragraph sectioning. The user said to maintain original paragraph sectioning, so each paragraph in the text should be a <p> element.

The signature is "Euer Wohlgeboren ergebenster Freund" which is at the end of the body text. Then the dateline "Hartig / Graz am 22. Dez823" is the sender's name and date.

Wait, the signature is the sender's closing, so in TEI, the <signature> element is used for that. The dateline is the date and place, so <dateline>.

Putting it all together, the XML would have the <body> with a <div type="letter"> containing the paragraphs, the <signature>, and the <dateline>.

I need to make sure that the original spelling and punctuation are preserved. For example, "Dez823" is written as "Dez823" without a space, and "Hochgeehrtester" with the correct spelling.

Also, the user mentioned that the address should not be encoded with <address>, but in this case, the address isn't present, only the dateline. So, the line "Hartig / Graz am 22. Dez823" is the sender's name and the date, so "Hartig" is the sender's name, and "Graz am 22. Dez823" is the dateline.

Therefore, the structure is:

- <div type="letter">
  - <p>Salutation</p>
  - <p>Body paragraph 1</p>
  - <p>Body paragraph 2</p>
  - ...
  - <signature>Hartig</signature>
  - <dateline>Graz am 22. Dez823</dateline>
</div>

But I need to check if the signature is part of the <div type="letter">. In TEI, the <signature> is part of the letter structure, so it should be inside the <div type="letter">.

Now, the user's example might have a <postscript> if there is one, but in this letter, there's no postscript mentioned. The closing is the signature and dateline.

So, the final XML should have the <body> with the <div type="letter">, containing the paragraphs, signature, and dateline.

    <p>Wohlgeborner Herr! Hochgeehrtester Herr Hofrat! Wertester Freund!</p>
    <p>Um Ihrem Wunsche zu entsprechen, habe ich die Einleitung getroffen, daß die mir mit dem freundschaftlichen Schreiben vom 5ten l M zugesendeten Stanzen nicht in den Aufmerksamen eingerückt werden, wenn sie etwa dem Redakteur dieses Blattes zukommen sollten, eine Vorsicht, die gewiß, wenn schon einmal dieß ansprechende Gedicht dem Publikum vorenthalten werden soll, um so notweniger war, als Kollmann nur zu froh sein dürfte, einen solchen reichen Fund für seinen armen, keine Aufmerksamkeit erweckende Aufmerksamen machen zu können. Ihre Meinung bezüglich auf das steirische Wappen teile ich vollkommen, da sie der Natur zu vollständig anpasset, während ihr jene der Grazer Zwang antut.</p>
    <p>– Muchar ist hier als Supplent der Lehrkanzel des Bibelstudiums alten und neuen Bundes, hat sich nur die Erstere und zugleich auch um die Kanzel der Geschichte nach Schneller in Kompetenz gesetzet. Was Sie mir von der kaustischen Laune des L Byron mitteilten hat mich sehr erlustigt, da ich das Werk selbst noch nicht in Händen habe, und hier, wo die Mehrzahl der Leute aus der großen Welt vielleicht nicht einmal weiß, daß es einen Byron gibt, auch nichts darüber sprechen hörte; die Buchhändler hier dürfen derlei Gift nicht führen, obwohl es nirgend unschädlicher als hier wäre, weil es selbst wenn es genossen werden würde, gewiß unverdaut, ohne Anwendung der in England neu erfundenen Maschine zum Ausräumen des Magens wieder abginge.</p>
    <p>In der Tat, es lebt sich hier recht gut, nur darf man in der geistigen Nahrung, die man in der Gesellschaft erhält, keine Recherches, sondern allenfalls nur derbe Hausmannskost suchen. Damit will ich nicht sagen, daß es in Graz an Gelehrten gebricht, ganz und gar nicht! Doch muß man sie in den Studierkämmerchen suchen, wo sie aber ganz natürlich wenig genießbar sind. Überhaupt ist der gesellige Ton durch Steifheit und Stolz ein wahrer Mißton: ich gebe mir alle Mühe diese Dissonanz aufzulösen, und lästiges Ceremonial zu verbannen, doch da tritt wie immer der durchlauchtigste Prinz Hohenzollern und der durchlauchtige Prinz Hohenlohe in den Weg, welche beide ihre Atmosphäre von Langweile überall mit sich tragen, und durch die aus der Rüstkammer des hohen Ahnherrn, der großen Kurfürsten von Brandenburg hervorgegangenen Uniformsgesetze auch die übrigen subalternen Waffengenossen für die Gesellschaft ungenießbar machen.</p>
    <p>Um Ihnen den Schlüssel zu dieser Dithyrambe zu geben, muß ich Ihnen sagen, daß die Prinzen, um die Uniform zu Ehren zu bringen, den Offizieren befehlen, zu mir, trotz meines ausgesprochenen Wunsches, in Uniform zu kommen, und durch Tagsbefehl sogar die Hosen (nämlich weiße oder schwarze), die sie anziehen sollen, bestimmen. Gegen solche Tollheit gibt es für mich gar kein Schutzmittel als jenes der Persiflage, wovon ich auch vollen Gebrauch mache. Kommen Sie doch her und sehen Sie dem Spuke zu, wäre es auch nur auf einige Tage: dann gilt bei der Rückkehr in das gesellige Wien gewiß das bekannte meminisse juvabit!</p>
    <p>– Und nun zum Schlusse empfangen Sie meine aufrichtigsten Wünsche zum bevorstehenden Jahreswechsel vereint mit jenen meiner Frau, die Versicherung der ausgezeichnetsten Hochachtung und Freundschaft, womit ich bin und bleibe Euer Wohlgeboren ergebenster Freund</p>

RAW LLM RESPONSE:
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this TEI encoding task. First, I need to make sure I understand the user's requirements and the provided rules. The user wants the letter encoded into TEI XML, following specific guidelines, except for the salutation and address rules which have exceptions.

Starting with the structure. The main root element should be <body>, and within that, a <div type="letter"> for the main letter content. The letter includes the dateline, salutation, body, signature, and postscript. There's also a mention of an address, but in the given text, I don't see any address part, so maybe the <div type="address"> isn't needed here. Wait, the user's example might have an address, but in this letter, the only address-like part is the dateline at the end: "Dr d 3 Sept XXIV." That's probably the date line, not an address. So maybe the <div type="address"> isn't required here. But the user's rules mention that <div> can contain <address> without being in an <ab>, but in this case, there's no address. So I can skip that part.

Next, the salutation. The user's rules say that p elements can contain a <salute> element if the salutation is within a paragraph. In the given letter, the salutation is "Nur zwei Worte, mein alter, edler Freund!" which is the opening line. However, in the example provided by the user, the salutation is part of a paragraph. Wait, the original text starts with that line, which is the salutation. According to the exception rule 1, if the salutation is embedded in a paragraph, it can be within a <p> with a <salute> element. But in this case, the salutation is the first line, and the rest of the text is the body. So maybe the first sentence is the salutation, and the rest is the body. However, the user's example might have a different structure. Let me check the original text again.

The original letter starts with "Nur zwei Worte, mein alter, edler Freund!" which is clearly a salutation. Then the rest is the body of the letter. So according to the rules, even though the salutation is in a paragraph, we can use <salute> inside a <p>. But in TEI, typically, the salutation is a separate element. However, the user's exception allows <p> to contain <salute> when it's embedded in a paragraph. So I should enclose the salutation line in a <p> with a <salute> element.

Then, the body of the letter. The main content is the rest of the text after the salutation. The user's rules mention maintaining original paragraph sectioning. The original text has paragraphs separated by line breaks. But the user says to maintain original paragraph sectioning, so I need to check if there are any line breaks that indicate new paragraphs. In the given text, after the salutation, the next line starts with "Ihr Zorn wäre gerecht..." which is the body. Then there's a line break after "Nehmen Sie sichs nicht so Herzen." Then another line break after "Er hat nun aber beiliegende Anweisung geben müssen..." and so on. So I need to split into <p> elements where the original paragraphs are. Let me count the paragraphs:

1. "Nur zwei Worte..." (salutation)
2. "Ihr Zorn wäre gerecht..." to "...umschiffen."
3. "Da läßt sich nun freilich nicht gleich..." to "...beschwichtigt."
4. "Übrigens habe ich den Buchhändler..." to "...ausliefern wird."
5. "Wenn nicht die mit Anmerkungen..." to "...Epilogus machen."
6. "Wie sagen Sie von der Großtat der Ipsarioten?"

Each of these would be separate <p> elements. However, the first one is the salutation, which we can handle with <salute> inside a <p>.

Then the signature: "Mit alter Treu und Lieb, aber fürchterlich durch Zeitklemmen erregt, Ihr Böttiger" is the closing. In TEI, the signature is usually within a <signed> element inside a <p> or <div>. But the user's rules don't mention the signature specifically, so I'll need to place it in a <p> with a <signed> element.

The dateline is "Dr d 3 Sept XXIV." which is the date. In TEI, the dateline is typically a <date> element within a <head> or <div>. However, the user's rules mention using a <div type="letter"> for the main letter including the dateline. So I'll include the dateline as a <date> within the <div type="letter">.

Putting it all together:

- <body>
  - <div type="letter">
    - <date>Dr d 3 Sept XXIV.</date>
    - <p><salute>Nur zwei Worte, mein alter, edler Freund!</salute></p>
    - <p>Ihr Zorn wäre gerecht, wenn nicht in der abgeänderten Stelle Ihres Epinikion eine für uns Norddeutsche durchaus unstatthafte Verwechslung stattgefunden hätte. Wir sagen: der Ruin der Mauer, des Reichs ist unvermeidlich. Die Ruine des Theseustempels. Das hatten Sie verwechselt und der einstweilige Redakteuer der AbZ – Theodor Hell ist mit seiner jungen Frau nach Kassel und auf den Harz verreiset – wollte das Ärgernis umschiffen.</p>
    - <p>Da läßt sich nun freilich nicht gleich die ganze Idee widergeben. Nehmen Sie sichs nicht so Herzen. Man weiß ja nicht, daß Sie der Urquell sind.</p>
    - <p>–Der junge Mann hat bloß die Stelle, die seinen Bruder unmittelbar betrifft, aus Ihrem Manuskript für den Bruder – nicht fürs Publikum – übersetzt. Also wäre auch hier Ihre Klage beschwichtigt.</p>
    - <p>Übrigens habe ich den Buchhändler Hilscher das Gewissen geschärft, daß Sie noch kein Exemplar der Schottischen Übersetzung hätten. Er schwört, eines abgeschickt zu haben. Er hat nun aber beiliegende Anweisung geben müssen, worauf Ihnen Gerold sogleich eines ausliefern wird.</p>
    - <p>Wenn nicht die mit Anmerkungen von Lindau bereicherte Übersetzung des Haji Baba, die zu gleicher Zeit bei Rein in Leipzig erschien, zu großen Abbruch tut, erlebt die Dresdner Übersetzung gewiß eine zweite Auflage, und da soll Ihr Brief einen schönen Epilogus machen. Wie sagen Sie von der Großtat der Ipsarioten?</p>
    - <p><signed>Mit alter Treu und Lieb, aber fürchterlich durch Zeitklemmen erregt, Ihr Böttiger</signed></p>
  - </div>
- </body>

Wait, but the date in the original is written as "Dr d 3 Sept XXIV." The "Dr" might be an abbreviation for "Doctor" or something else. However, the user's rules state to maintain original spelling and orthography, so I should keep it as is. The date is placed in a <date> element within the <div type="letter">.

Also, the postscript isn't present here, so no <p> with <postscript> needed. The closing is handled by the <signed> element.

I need to ensure that all elements are properly nested and that the XML is valid. Also, check for any special characters like "–" (en dash) and "–" (em dash), but in the original text, there's a dash after "Herzen." and another after "Bruder". The user says to preserve original characters, so I'll keep them as they are.

Another thing to check: the use of <salute> within a <p> as per the exception. The first paragraph is the salutation, so that's correct.

I think that covers all the parts. Now, I'll structure the XML accordingly.

RAW LLM RESPONSE:
<think>
Okay, I need to encode this letter into TEI XML following the given rules. Let me start by recalling the structure and elements required.

First, the root element should be <body>, and inside that, a <div type="letter"> for the main letter content. The address, if present, would go into a <div type="address">, but the user mentioned that addresses are handled separately, and the example might not have one here. Let me check the letter again. The first line is "Caen, le 12 Mai 1827" which is the dateline, not an address. The address might be part of the letter's structure, but according to the rules, the address is a separate div. However, in this case, the letter starts with the dateline, then the salutation "Mon cher monsieur," which is a salutation. The rules say that except for salutations and addresses, the standard TEI applies. So the salutation is within a paragraph, so I can use <p> with <salute> inside.

Wait, the exception says that p elements may contain a salute element when the salutation is embedded within a paragraph. So the first line is the dateline, which is part of the letter's structure. Then the salutation is "Mon cher monsieur," which is within a paragraph, so I should wrap that in a <p> and include <salute> inside. Then the rest of the letter content would be in <p> elements as needed.

The dateline is part of the letter, so inside the <div type="letter">, the first element would be <dateline> with the date. Then the salutation in a <p> with <salute>, followed by the body of the letter in <p> elements. The signature is at the end: "Adieu, croyez-mi..." which is the closing. The signature is usually in a <signed> element. Also, there's a postscript? Let me check the text. The letter ends with "Adieu, croyez-moi, toujours Votre bien sincère ami Trébutien". That's the closing and signature. There's no postscript mentioned here.

Now, looking at the content, the letter has several paragraphs. Each paragraph in the original is separated by line breaks, so I need to preserve the original paragraphing. The user mentioned to maintain original paragraph sectioning and only mark new line beginnings in salutations. So each paragraph in the original should be a <p> element.

The text has some mentions of works like "Mille et Une Nuits", "Le Juif de Dondey-Dupré", "Mithriaca", etc., but I need to ensure that the encoding doesn't alter the original content. Also, the original spelling and orthography must be preserved, including any foreign words or special characters.

Now, structuring the XML:

- Start with <body>
  - <div type="letter">
    - <dateline>Caen, le 12 Mai 1827</dateline>
    - <p>
      - <salute>Mon cher monsieur,</salute>
      - [rest of the first paragraph text]
    </p>
    - <p>[next paragraph]</p>
    - ... and so on for each paragraph
    - <signed>Adieu, croyez-moi, toujours Votre bien sincère ami</signed>
    - <name>Trébutien</name>
  </div>

Wait, the signature might be a <signed> element containing the closing and the name. The <signed> element typically includes the closing formula and the name. So "Adieu, croyez-moi, toujours Votre bien sincère ami" is the closing, and "Trébutien" is the name. So the <signed> would include both parts. Let me check TEI guidelines: the <signed> element contains the closing formula and the name. So the structure would be:

<signed>
  <formula>Adieu, croyez-moi, toujours Votre bien sincère ami</formula>
  <name>Trébutien</name>
</signed>

But the original text has the closing and the name on the same line. However, the user's instructions say to preserve the original structure and order. So perhaps the <signed> element should have the entire line as is. Alternatively, if the name is on a new line, but in the given text, it's written as "Adieu, croyez-moi, toujours Votre bien sincère ami Trébutien" with the name following immediately. So in that case, the <signed> would be:

<signed>Adieu, croyez-moi, toujours Votre bien sincère ami Trébutien</signed>

But the <name> element is for the sender's name. So maybe:

<signed>
  <formula>Adieu, croyez-moi, toujours Votre bien sincère ami</formula>
  <name>Trébutien</name>
</signed>

But the original text doesn't have a line break between the formula and the name. The user's instruction says to maintain original paragraph sectioning and only mark new line beginnings in salutations. Since the original has the formula and name on the same line, perhaps the <signed> should include both in a single element. However, according to TEI, the <signed> should contain the formula and the name as separate elements. But the user's example might not have that. Let me check the user's instructions again.

The user says: "Only return the XML code without additional explanations." But I need to follow TEI guidelines as per the rules given. The user's example might not include the <formula> and <name> separately, but in the absence of specific instructions, I should use the standard TEI structure. However, the user's rule says that except for salutations and addresses, the standard TEI applies. But the salutation is handled with the <salute> inside a <p>, and the signature would be a <signed> element. So I think the correct approach is to use <signed> with <formula> and <name> as appropriate.

But the original text has "Adieu, croyez-moi, toujours Votre bien sincère ami Trébutien" as the closing and name. So the <formula> is "Adieu, croyez-moi, toujours Votre bien sincère ami" and the <name> is "Trébutien". Therefore, the <signed> would contain both elements.

Now, the body of the letter has several paragraphs. Each paragraph in the original text is separated by line breaks. The user says to maintain original paragraph sectioning, so each paragraph is a <p> element. The first line after the salutation is a new paragraph.

Also, the letter includes references to other works and mentions of names, but since the encoding rules don't mention anything about those, just to preserve the original content.

I need to ensure that all the text is included, without abbreviations, and that the structure is correct. Let me go through the text step by step, splitting into paragraphs as they are in the original.

The first paragraph after the salutation is:

"Je vous avais promis dans ma dernière lettre de vous écrire de Paris où j’étais sur le point d’aller, mais différentes circonstances ont retardé mon voyage et durant le peu de jours que j’ai passés à Paris, je n’ai pu trouver le temps ou plutôt l’occasion de remplir ma promesse."

Then the next paragraph starts with "Je suis vraiment honteux de vous annoncer que l’impression de Votre Mémoire n’est pas encore commencée..." and so on.

Each of these is a separate <p> element.

Now, for the encoding, I'll structure the XML accordingly, making sure that the <dateline>, <salute>, <p> elements, and <signed> are properly placed.

Also, check for any possible <address> elements. The original letter doesn't have a separate address section, only the dateline at the beginning. So the <div type="address"> is not needed here.

Another thing to note is the use of <lb> for line breaks within paragraphs. However, the user's instruction says to maintain original paragraph sectioning and only mark new line beginnings in salutations. Since the original text doesn't have line breaks indicated (like in the salutation), but the paragraphs are separated by line breaks, I need to represent those as <p> elements. The user says to maintain original paragraph sectioning, so each paragraph is a <p>.

Thus, the final XML should have the structure:

<body>
  <div type="letter">
    <dateline>Caen, le 12 Mai 1827</dateline>
    <p>
      <salute>Mon cher monsieur,</salute>
      [First paragraph text]
    </p>
    <p>[Second paragraph text]</p>
    ...
    <p>[Last paragraph before signature]</p>
    <signed>
      <formula>Adieu, croyez-moi, toujours Votre bien sincère ami</formula>
      <name>Trébutien</name>
    </signed>
  </div>
</body>

I'll need to make sure that all the text is included in the appropriate <p> elements, with the <salute> in the first <p>, and the <signed> at the end.
</think>

<body>
  <div type="letter">
    <dateline>Caen, le 12 Mai 1827</dateline>
    <p>
      <salute>Mon cher monsieur,</salute>
      Je vous avais promis dans ma dernière lettre de vous écrire de Paris où j’étais sur le point d’aller, mais différentes circonstances ont retardé mon voyage et durant le peu de jours que j’ai passés à Paris, je n’ai pu trouver le temps ou plutôt l’occasion de remplir ma promesse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Je suis vraiment honteux de vous annoncer que l’impression de Votre Mémoire n’est pas encore commencée et qu’elle sera peut-être même différée encore de quelques semaines; l’état actuel des choses en France et surtout l’épouvante que de loi sur la presse a répandue dans tout le commerce en général et dans celui de l’imprimerie et de la librairie en particulier, font qu’il est entièrement difficile de trouver dans ce moment-ci quelqu’un qui veuille se charger de l’impression d’un ouvrage quelconque.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cependant soyez certain que le vôtre sera publié. J’en ai pris l’engagement, et je remplirai ma promesse, dussé-je en faire seul les frais. En dépit de tout, les Mille et Une Nuits se réimpriment toujours, ainsi le Juif de Dondey-Dupré se charge de publier la traduction que j’ai faite de Vos Contes inédits des Mille et Une Nuits. Le second volume paraîtra d’ici à six semaines ou deux mois.
    </p>
    <p>
      Je publie d’abord le second volume, car je serai bien aise de profiter pour l’avertissement que je joindrai au premier, de cet article dont Vous m’avez parlé et de tout ce dont vous pourrez m’enrichir. J’ai été obligé d’user d’un peu de charlatanerie envers Dondey-Dupré en lui assurant que vous avez revu mon travail sur le texte arabe, car on lui a dit que M. Zinserling, sachant assez mal le français et n’ayant pas toujours bien compris le sens de votre manuscrit, a fait dans sa traduction allemande des contre-sens et des méprises fort plaisantes.
    </p>
    <p>
      – J’ai changé toutes les tournures et les expressions qui m’ont paru appartenir à nos mœurs et à nos usages et que je crois, n’ont jamais pu être em Mithriaca ou les mithriaques : mémoire académique sur le culte solaire de Mithra / par Joseph de Hammer; publ. par J. Spencer Smith ployées par des Orientaux. Ainsi grâce à ces épurations il ne reste plus rien de trop choquant: ainsi la nourrice de la princesse Vie-des-Amis ne dit plus qu’elle y perdra son latin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Je n’ai pas vu l’original, mais je parierais ma tête que cette expression ne s’y trouve pas, car, si quelques savants arabes, ainsi qu’on l’assure, ont connu le latin, cette langue n’ete pas assez répandue pour avoir donné lieu à des expressions proverbiales.
    </p>
    <p>
      – Vous trouverez tout cela bien minutieux, mais vous savez déjà combien je tiens à la couleur locale. – Aussitôt que la première livraison de ma traduction aura paru, je m’empresserai de vous l’envoyer; dites-moi, si vous voulez que je vous en adresse plusieurs exemplaires. – Ainsi que je vous ai déjà prié si vous avez quelques nouveaux renseignements à me donner. – Je les recevrai avec d’autant plus de reconnaissances que vous savez combien je suis passionné pour tout ce qui concerne les Mille et Une Nuits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Je vous envoie en échange de votre Mohammed que vous m’avez annoncé, le Mahomet de Voltaire publié avec un commentaire de M. Humbert, professeur d’arabe à l’académie de Genève; peut-être serez-vous bien aise de voir son opinion sur l’ouvrage du philosophe français et comment il relève la violation des traditions historiques qu’on rencontre partout dans cette pièce qui du reste est presque toujours admirable sous le rapport du style.
    </p>
    <p>
      Je joins à ce volume le recueil des Poésies de Mme Amable Tastu qui ont obtenu un tel succès que la première tirée à plus de trois mille exemplaires, a été enlevé en moins de deux mois: Je ne crains pas de dire que jamais aucune femme, en France, n’avait possédé autant de talent pour la poésie; elle peut être placée à côté, et peut-être même au-dessus, des plus grands poètes de notre époque.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ayant eu occasion de la voir lors de mon voyage à Paris, je me suis trouvé engagé à lui promettre de lui adresser une pièce de vers persans; si j’ai beaucoup de mal à en faire de français, ce n’est assurément pas pour en faire dans la langue de Hafiz. Vous vous êtes sans doute déjà aperçu, où j’en veux venir. Ainsi, si vous, qui chantez les dames avec tant de bonheur dans tous les idiômes, vouliez m’envoyer seulement un bout ou deux, vous me feriez un véritable plaisir.
    </p>
    <p>
      – Je vous fais cette demande avec d’autant plus de crainte que je sens combien je suis coupable envers vous pour l’ode que je vous annonce depuis longtemps. Mais imaginez-vous que sous le rapport de la lenteur dans mes compositions poétiques (et tout ce rapport seulement) je ressemble à notre Malherbe qui mit – dit-on – six ans à composer une ode. Une autre fois ayant entrepris des hymnes sur la mort de la présidente de Verdun, mais il y passa trois ans environ, et lorsqu’il les présenta au mari pour le consoler, celui-ci était marié en secondes noces depuis longtemps.
    </p>
    <p>
      J’ai joint à une Vue de Caen que M. S Smith vous a envoyée l’autre jour, plusieurs mauvaises lithographies de quelques-uns des monuments de notre ville qu’on a surnommée, je ne sais trop à quel titre l’Athènes de la Normandie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Je lis toujours votre Histoire Ottomane; si votre réputation n’eut pas été parvenue à son comble, cet ouvrage n’avait pu qu’y ajouter beaucoup.

RAW LLM RESPONSE:
the assistant provided an answer that was not valid TEI XML. The error was in the use of the address element as a direct child of the letter div, which is not allowed in TEI. The address element should be nested within an ab element. The assistant also used a div element with type "letter" as a direct child of the body element, which is not valid according to TEI guidelines. The correct structure should be to have the letter div as a child of the body element, and the address as a child of an ab element within the letter div. Additionally, the assistant used the address element as a direct child of the letter div, which is not valid. The address element should be nested within an ab element. The assistant also used the p element with the salute element, which is not valid according to the provided encoding rules. The salute element should be a child of the p element, not a separate element. The assistant also used the div element with type "letter" as a direct child of the body element, which is not valid according to TEI guidelines. The correct structure should be to have the letter div as a child of the body element, and the address as a child of an ab element within the letter div.

      <salute>Hochverehrter Herr und Freund!</salute>
      Der erste Brief, den ich in dem neuen Jahre schreibe, ist, wie billig, an Sie gerichtet. Empfangen Sie meine herzlichsten Glückwünsche für Ihr und Ihres ganzen Hauses Wohlergehen! Von Fräulein Schwab die in Begleitung der Frau Nies in Wien war, habe ich zu meiner Freude die neuesten und unmittelbarsten Nachrichten über Ihr Wohlbefinden erhalten. Dieselbe hat mir das ihr mitgegebene Exemplar Ihres schönen Büchleins „O Kind!“ glücklich überbracht und ich sage Ihnen dafür, sowie auch für den bereits empfangenen dritten Teil des orientalischen Bildersaales – den zweiten Teil hat mir aber Leske nicht geschickt – meinen verbindlichsten Dank. Sie haben nun dem Cerberus einen Brocken in den Schlund geworfen, woran er erwürgen mag. Die Schlossersche Anzeige Ihres Lebens Mohammeds hat durch meine Vermittlung eine darüber von Weil und Bähr schon wieder eingelieferte Rezension glücklich aus den Jahrbüchern beseitigt, mit denen ich übrigens von nun an nichts mehr zu tun haben mag. Sie hätten schon längst eingehen sollen, da sie ihren früheren und wohlverdienten Credit gänzlich verloren haben. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Der von Ihnen für meine Zeitschrift gütigst eingesandte Beitrag, über welchen Sie Auskunft wünschen, hat wegen einer großen Fülle älteren Materials und älterer Verbindlichkeiten bis jetzt zurückgelegt werden müssen, wird aber unfehlbar im dritten Hefte dieses Jahrganges – des zehnten – abgedruckt werden, welches Heft ich Ihnen dann sogleich zusenden werde. Das Journal macht mir und dem Verleger große Freude, indem es von Jahr zu Jahr an Ansehen zunimmt und in alle Länder Europas sich verbreitet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erhalte Ihnen Gott die Frische und Jugend Ihres Geistes auch in diesem Jahre in ungeschwächter Kraft. Die Phantasie wird Sie nie altern lassen; in ihr fließt der Lebensquell. Wie Fräulein Schwab Sie mir schildert, müssen Sie noch aussehen wie 1819. Könnte ich nur einmal wieder bei Ihnen sein! aber der Schwierigkeiten sind gar zu viele und große. – Meine Frau empfiehlt sich mit mir Ihnen und Ihrer Frau Gemahlin bestens. In treuer Liebe

LETTER 7 - LLM RESPONSE
================================================================================
Filename: letter6099.txt

RAW LLM RESPONSE:
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this TEI encoding task. First, I need to make sure I understand all the rules provided. The user wants the letter encoded with specific structural elements, except for the salutation and address, which have exceptions. Let me start by breaking down the letter into its components.

The letter begins with a dateline: "Bremen am 2. März 1840." According to the rules, the main letter should be in a div with type "letter". The dateline is part of the letter's structure, so I'll put that in a <dateline> element inside the letter div.

Next, the salutation. The user mentioned that p elements can contain a salute element if the salutation is within a paragraph. The first part after the dateline is "Obgleich der Josephtag noch ziemlich entfernt ist..." but I need to check if there's a clear salutation. Wait, looking at the text, the first paragraph doesn't seem to be a salutation. The actual salutation might be missing here, but the user's example might have different structure. Wait, the user's example might not have a salutation, but the rules mention that the exception applies when the salutation is embedded in a paragraph. However, in this letter, the first line after the dateline is the body, not a salutation. So maybe there's no separate salutation here. The user's note says to encode all structural blocks except salutation and address, but the user's instruction says to encode all except salutation and address. Wait, the task says: "encode all structural letter blocks with appropriate and valid TEI markup (except the salutation and the address rule)". So I should not encode the salutation and address as per the exceptions. Wait, but the user provided an example where the salutation is in a p with a salute? Or maybe the user's example is different. Let me check the original letter again.

Looking at the letter, after the dateline, the text starts with "Obgleich der Josephtag noch ziemlich entfernt ist..." which seems like the body of the letter, not a salutation. So perhaps there's no explicit salutation here. The user's encoding rules mention that the exception applies to salutations and addresses, but the user's task says to encode all structural blocks except those. So maybe the salutation isn't present here, so I don't need to handle it. But I need to make sure.

Then, the body of the letter is several paragraphs. The user says to maintain original paragraph sectioning, so I'll use <p> elements for each paragraph. The address part is mentioned in the rules, but the user's letter doesn't have an address. The original text doesn't have an address, so maybe the address is not present here. The user's example might have different structure, but in this case, the letter seems to be a single letter with dateline, body, signature, and postscript.

Wait, looking at the end: "Tausendmal umarmt Dich Tuissimus Hormayr" – that's the signature. Then the postscript? Wait, after the main body, the last part is the signature. The user's letter doesn't have a postscript, but the signature is at the end. So the structure would be: dateline, body (multiple paragraphs), signature.

So the main elements would be:

- <div type="letter">
  - <dateline>Bremen am 2. März 1840.</dateline>
  - <p>...</p> for each paragraph
  - <signature>Tausendmal umarmt Dich Tuissimus Hormayr</signature>
  
But according to the rules, the <signature> is not mentioned, but the TEI guidelines typically have a <signature> element. However, the user's instructions don't specify exceptions for the signature, so I should include it.

Wait, the user's encoding rules mention that the div of type "letter" includes the dateline, salutations, letter content, signature, and postscript. So the signature is part of the letter div. So I need to include the signature in the letter div.

Now, the body content: the letter has multiple paragraphs. The first paragraph is from "Obgleich..." to "...unter den Zierden Österreichs..." Then the next paragraph starts with "Mögest Du doch..." and so on. Each paragraph should be in a <p> element.

The user's note says to maintain original paragraph sectioning, so I need to split the text into paragraphs as they are in the original. Let me check the original letter again for paragraph breaks.

Original text:

Bremen am 2. März 1840.

Obgleich der Josephtag noch ziemlich entfernt ist, benütze ich dennoch eine heute sich darbietende sichere Gelegenheit, Dir und Deinem ganzen Hause die nachhaltigsten und aufrichtigsten Glückwünsche darzubringen, mit der alten und doch immer neuen Huldigung gegen Dein vielseitiges und großes Verdienst, das kein Neid und keine Bosheit zu verkümmern vermag und das in der Wahrheit und in der Dichtung Deinen Namen stets voranstellen wird unter den Zierden Österreichs, unter seinen Historikern, Dichtern, Reisenden, Ethno- und Geographen. Mögest Du doch Deinen Treuen seit 42 Jahren mit guten Nachrichten von Dir, von Deiner unvergeßlichen Frau Gemahlin und von Deiner Familie erfreuen. Sie werden mir und meiner Frau ein wahres Fest bereiten.

Mein Taschenbuch wurde Dir doch gehörig behändiget und Salm’s Ehrengedächtnis fand gewiß auch zu Deinem Herzen den Weg. Ich glaube wenigstens, manchen ehrenwerten österreichischen Namen zu verdienter Ehre genannt zu haben. Auersperg hast Du wohl seit seiner Vermählung in Wien gesehen? Möge ihm sein Ruhm und recht viel Glück bewahrt sein. Was macht Grillparzer’s edler Genius, der mir doch etwas runzlicht und schrumpflicht zu werden scheint? Was macht der trostlose Saganische Witwer Zedlitz? Der Patriarch Pyrker gibt doch regelmäßig vierteljährig einen Laut von sich. Der Buchhändlerweg über/Leipzig ist sicher und doch auch ziemlich schnell. In Bremen ist die bekannte Buchhandlung I.G. Heyse (einst bei Schaumburg in Wien) vollkommen zuverlässig. Des Schaffhauser Bibliothekars Maurer-Constant Briefe von Gentz an Johannes Müller mögen Dir wohl denselben ungemeinen Eindruck gemacht haben wie mir, der ich 1802/1806 in der Staatskanzlei von Allem ein so naher Augenzeuge war. Der unvergleichliche und unvergeßliche Erzherzog Johann spielt darin die ihm gebührende Rolle. In Wien ist wohl nicht viel davon die Rede gewesen, denn die Leute sind tot, wie aber, wenn ähnliche und noch wichtigere Dinge hervorkommen (1810–1815) aus der Serie der bonapartistischen Memoirs, namentlich von Caulaincourt, Baron du Fain, wo aber noch ganz andere Dinge schlummern und demnächst erwachen werden?? Es kömmt noch ein Nachtrag von großem Gewicht – Müller und seine zwei politisch wichtigsten Freunde (d’Antraigues und Armfelt). Diese beiden haben freilich zugleich in Wien, in Petersburg und zum Teil in Windsor, Berlin und Stockholm tief in die Karten jener wahrhaft erbärmlichen Zeit geschaut.

Noch einmal wiederhole ich die mir unendlich angelegene Bitte um Nachricht über Dich und über die Deinigen, einen mir in hoher Wahrheit teueren und unvergeßlichen Gegenstand. Tausendmal umarmt Dich Tuissimus

Hormayr

So the first paragraph after the dateline is the first long paragraph ending with "...unter den Zierden Österreichs..." Then the next paragraph starts with "Mögest Du doch..." and ends with "...geschaut." Then the next paragraph starts with "Noch einmal..." and ends with the signature.

So the structure would be:

- <div type="letter">
  - <dateline>Bremen am 2. März 1840.</dateline>
  - <p>First paragraph text</p>
  - <p>Second paragraph text</p>
  - <p>Third paragraph text</p>
  - <signature>Tausendmal umarmt Dich Tuissimus Hormayr</signature>
</div>

Wait, but the third paragraph ends with "Tausendmal umarmt Dich Tuissimus" and then "Hormayr" is on the next line. In the original text, the signature is split into two lines. So in TEI, the <signature> should include both lines, perhaps with <lb/> for line break. But the user's rules say to maintain original paragraph sectioning and only mark new line beginnings in salutations. However, the signature is not a salutation, so line breaks in the signature should be marked with <lb/>.

Wait, the user's rules say: "Maintain original paragraph sectioning. Only mark new line beginnings in salutations". So in the body, paragraphs are separated as they are, but line breaks within paragraphs (like in the signature) should be marked with <lb/>. However, the signature is a separate element. So in the original, the signature is split into two lines: "Tausendmal umarmt Dich Tuissimus" and "Hormayr". So I should put <lb/> between them in the <signature> element.

So the <signature> would be:

<signature>Tausendmal umarmt Dich Tuissimus<lb/>Hormayr</signature>

Now, checking the rest. The body paragraphs: each paragraph is separated by a line break. The original has a blank line between the paragraphs? Let me check the original text again. The original has:

After the first paragraph, there's a line break, then "Mein Taschenbuch..." which is the start of the second paragraph. Then after that, another line break, then "Noch einmal..." which is the third paragraph. So each paragraph is separated by a line break, which in TEI would be represented by <p> elements. The user's rules say to maintain original paragraph sectioning, so each paragraph is a <p> element.

So the three paragraphs are:

1. Obgleich der Josephtag... unter den Zierden Österreichs...
2. Mein Taschenbuch... geschaut.
3. Noch einmal... unvergeßlichen Gegenstand.

Then the signature.

Now, the user's example might have different structure, but according to the rules provided, I need to encode the structure as per TEI, except for salutations and addresses. Since there's no salutation or address in this letter, I can proceed with the above structure.

Also, the user mentioned that the <address> element can be in a div without being nested in an ab. But in this case, there's no address, so that's not needed.

Now, checking for special characters: the original has "du Fain" with a non-breaking space. In TEI, I should represent that as &nbsp; or just keep the space as is, but since the user says to preserve original orthography, I'll keep it as "du Fain" with the en dash or whatever is present. Wait, in the original text, it's written as "Baron du Fain" with a space before the F. In XML, spaces are preserved, so I can just keep it as is.

Also, the date is "2. März 1840." with a period, which is part of the dateline.

Now, putting it all together, the TEI XML would be:

<TEI>
  <body>
    <div type="letter">
      <dateline>Bremen am 2. März 1840.</dateline>
      <p>Obgleich der Josephtag noch ziemlich entfernt ist, benütze ich dennoch eine heute sich darbietende sichere Gelegenheit, Dir und Deinem ganzen Hause die nachhaltigsten und aufrichtigsten Glückwünsche darzubringen, mit der alten und doch immer neuen Huldigung gegen Dein vielseitiges und großes Verdienst, das kein Neid und keine Bosheit zu verkümmern vermag und das in der Wahrheit und in der Dichtung Deinen Namen stets voranstellen wird unter den Zierden Österreichs, unter seinen Historikern, Dichtern, Reisenden, Ethno- und Geographen.</p>

Möge ihm sein Ruhm und recht viel Glück bewahrt sein. Was macht Grillparzer’s edler Genius, der mir doch etwas runzlicht und schrumpflicht zu werden scheint? Was macht der trostlose Saganische Witwer Zedlitz? Der Patriarch Pyrker gibt doch regelmäßig vierteljährig einen Laut von sich. Der Buchhändlerweg über/Leipzig ist sicher und doch auch ziemlich schnell. In Bremen ist die bekannte Buchhandlung I.G. Heyse (einst bei Schaumburg in Wien) vollkommen zuverlässig. Des Schaffhauser Bibliothekars Maurer-Constant Briefe von Gentz an Johannes Müller mögen Dir wohl denselben ungemeinen Eindruck gemacht haben wie mir, der ich 1802/1806 in der Staatskanzlei von Allem ein so naher Augenzeuge war. Der unvergleichliche und unvergeßliche Erzherzog Johann spielt darin die ihm gebührende Rolle. In Wien ist wohl nicht viel davon die Rede gewesen, denn die Leute sind tot, wie aber, wenn ähnliche und noch wichtigere Dinge hervorkommen (1810–1815) aus der Serie der bonapartistischen Memoirs, namentlich von Caulaincourt, Baron du Fain, wo aber noch ganz andere Dinge schlummern und demnächst erwachen werden?? Es kömmt noch ein Nachtrag von großem Gewicht – Müller und seine zwei politisch wichtigsten Freunde (d’Antraigues und Armfelt). Diese beiden haben freilich zugleich in Wien, in Petersburg und zum Teil in Windsor, Berlin und Stockholm tief in die Karten jener wahrhaft erbärmlichen Zeit geschaut.</p>
      <p>Noch einmal wiederhole ich die mir unendlich angelegene Bitte um Nachricht über Dich und über die Deinigen, einen mir in hoher Wahrheit teueren und unvergeßlichen Gegenstand.</p>
      <signature>Tausendmal umarmt Dich Tuissimus<lb/>Hormayr</signature>
    </div>
  </body>
</TEI>

Wait, but the third paragraph in the original ends with "geschaut." and then the next paragraph starts with "Noch einmal..." So the third paragraph is the long one ending with "geschaut." and the fourth paragraph is the last one before the signature. Wait, looking back, the original text after the long paragraph is:

Noch einmal wiederhole ich die mir unendlich angelegene Bitte um Nachricht über Dich und über die Deinigen, einen mir in hoher Wahrheit teueren und unvergeßlichen Gegenstand. Tausendmal umarmt Dich Tuissimus

Hormayr

So the last paragraph before the signature is the one starting with "Noch einmal..." and the signature is split into two lines. Therefore, the structure would have four paragraphs?

Wait, let me recount the paragraphs:

1. "Obgleich der Josephtag..." to "...unter den Zierden Österreichs."
2. "Mögest Du doch..." to "...geschaut."
3. "Noch einmal..." to "...Gegenstand."
4. Then the signature.

Wait, the original has:

After the long paragraph ending with "geschaut." there's a line break, then "Noch einmal..." which is a new paragraph. Then after that, the signature. So the third paragraph is "Noch einmal..." and the fourth is the signature. So the body has three paragraphs (the first two and the third), and then the signature.

Wait, let me check again:

Original text:

[...]
geschaut.

Noch einmal wiederhole ich die mir unendlich angelegene Bitte um Nachricht über Dich und über die Deinigen, einen mir in hoher Wahrheit teueren und unvergeßlichen Gegenstand. Tausendmal umarmt Dich Tuissimus

Hormayr

So after the long paragraph ending with "geschaut." there's a line break, then "Noch einmal..." which is a new paragraph. Then the signature is split into two lines. So the structure is:

- Paragraph 1: from "Obgleich..." to "...unter den Zierden Österreichs."
- Paragraph 2: "Mögest Du doch..." to "...geschaut."
- Paragraph 3: "Noch einmal..." to "...Gegenstand."
- Signature: "Tausendmal..." and "Hormayr"

So in the XML, there are three <p> elements and one <signature>.

Therefore, the corrected structure would have three <p> elements and the <signature>. So the XML would have:

- <p> for the first paragraph
- <p> for the second
- <p> for the third
- <signature> for the last part

So the final XML would have three <p> elements and the <signature> with the line break.

LETTER 8 - LLM RESPONSE
================================================================================
Filename: letter66.txt

RAW LLM RESPONSE:
the user wants me to encode the given letter into TEI XML following the provided rules. Let me start by understanding the structure of the letter. The first line is the dateline: "Vienne ce 16 Sept 99". Then there's the salutation "Votre dernière lettre...", followed by the body of the letter, which includes several paragraphs. There's also a postscript and a signature at the end.

The encoding rules mention that I should use a body element as the root, with a div of type "letter" containing the dateline, salutation, content, signature, and postscript. The address is handled in a separate div with type "address", but since this letter doesn't have an address, I can skip that. 

The salutation is part of the first paragraph, so I need to include it within a p element. The user mentioned that p elements can contain a salute element if the salutation is embedded in a paragraph. However, looking at the example, the salutation here is part of the first paragraph, so I should check if the rules allow that. The first exception allows p elements to contain salute when embedded, so I can use that.

Next, the body of the letter has multiple paragraphs. I need to ensure that each paragraph is wrapped in a p element. The original paragraph structure should be preserved, so I'll split the text at the paragraph breaks as they are presented. 

The signature is "Jo Müller" at the end, which should be placed within a signature element inside the div of type "letter". 

There's a postscript mentioned in the text, but I need to check if that's present. Looking at the letter, the last part includes "Encore une chose..." which seems like a postscript. I'll need to wrap that in a postscript element. 

I also need to make sure to preserve the original spelling and orthography, like "bep" instead of "beaucoup" or "Phosphore" as written. No abbreviations should be used, and all content must be fully represented. 

Let me structure the XML step by step. Start with the body element, then a div with type "letter". Inside that, the dateline as a dateline element. Then the salutation within a p element. The body paragraphs each in their own p elements. The postscript as a postscript element, and the signature at the end. 

Wait, the user mentioned that the address rule is an exception, but since there's no address in this letter, I don't need to handle that. Also, check if the salutation is correctly marked. The first line after the dateline is the salutation, which is part of the first paragraph. So I'll use the p element with the salute inside if needed, but since it's part of the paragraph, maybe just the p element with the text. 

I think I have all the elements. Now, I'll construct the XML accordingly, making sure to follow the TEI structure and the given rules.

    <dateline>Vienne ce 16 Sept 99</dateline>
    <p>Votre dernière lettre, mon très-cher Hammer, m’a fait le plus grand plaisir. (Si je ne la cite pas par sa date, c’est que je n’ai pu déchiffrer celle-ci).</p>
    <p>Je vois avec infiniment de satisfaction que Vous êtes plus content, et mieux connu. Cela devait suivre naturellement de ceci. Mais pour juger de ce que Vous êtes, avouez, qu’il falait bien que M. l’Internonce Vous observât et Vous fit observer pendant quelque tems. Je savais bien, que, lorsqu’à travers l’inconcevable légèreté de l’extérieur il aura pénétré jusqu’aux qualités infiniment estimable de Votre moral, qu’il Vous rendra justice; je suis même persuadé, qu’il Vous aimera et estimera de plus en plus, et que, peut-être plutôt qu’aucun autre de Vos protecteurs, il Vous fera parvenir à Votre but. Je me suis aperçu de quelque chose à cet égard dans une lettre qu’il a écrite à M. de J, et qui m’a prouvé combien j’avais raison de Vous conseiller de mettre en lui toute Votre confiance et de tâcher de mériter de toute manière son approbation.</p>
    <p>Ainsi continuez, mon bon Ami; profitez des très-bonnes dispositions de M. l’Internonce; rendez-Vous agréable; suivez ses préceptes, ils sont, je Vous assure, très-bons. Puis attendez; tout réussira, à mesure, en son tems. Je ne connais pas un jeune homme pour qui l’on s’intéresse plus, ici, là, et ailleurs; pas un, qui ait tant de connaissances préliminaires, tant de dispositions, tant de probabilités, pour réussir: ne gâtez donc rien: Soyez en chaque sens et lieu tel que Vous devez être; ne croyez aucun devoir au-dessous de Vous, pas plus qu’aucune perfection, qu’il s’agit d’acquérir, tellement au-dessus que Vous n’y puissiez parvenir. Tenez-Vous surtout, je Vous en conjure, attaché à la vérité, et ne Vous la laissez pas escamoter par les jongleries d’une fausse science: La vérité (en prenant le mot dans le sens relatif à la littérature), la vérité que Vous devez chercher, est la connaissance de ce qui est ou a été en Orient ou parmi les peuples orientaux; Vous l’apprenez en étudiant leurs livres et surtout le grand livre de la nature et du monde vivant; mais que cela soit avec Votre coup d’œil juste, et non à travers les tubes colorés par lesquels beaucoup d’écrivains et voyageurs (Français surtout) ont partout vu ce qu’ils voulaient selon la convenance de leur faction politique, religieuse ou philosophique.</p>
    <p>J’ai lu avec beaucoup de plaisir la lettre que Vous m’avez prié de soigner pour W.: M. Lerse Vous répondra sans doute, je lui ai d’abord faire tenir la sienne. À propos que je Vous parle d’une bagatelle, mais qui est de celles qui échappent à Votre inadvertance. Dans la lettre à B. Vous Vous réjouissez de lui écrire des bords du Phosphore. Ne dirait-on pas que Vous ignorez de l’orthographie et l’étymologie du mot? Et que Vous confondez un détroit avec un astre? Le petit poème est charmant. J’ai lu hier au soir le perroquet que Vous avez donné à Madame de J.; le conte est amusant; Vous savez que je les aime beaucoup; ceux, c’est-à-dire, qui viennent de l’Orient ou du Midi, je n’en connais pas beaucoup de cru de l’Allemagne et des pays voisins qui les valent.</p>
    <p>J’ai aussi lu Votre lettre à Ch., qui contenait le voyage de Hermanstadt à Cple. Je me réjouis beaucoup d’en recevoir une un jour sur Cple, quand Vous aurez vu l’intérieur de la ville. Lisez la topographie de Gylius, uniquement pour Vous orienter un peu sur le local ancien. Ce dernier m’est très familier depuis que j’ai lu tous les Byzantins, mais depuis la disparition de tant d’illustres Monastères et Églises, qui m’orientaient, et depuis les incendies qui ont tant changé la disposition intérieure, je n’y connais que peu de choses : le palais qui était près de l’Hippodrome (Ahmeydan), S Sophie, quelques citernes; je ne sai pas même quels édifices occupent le local jadis si beau des Blanchernes. Pour les monumens de l’art je n’en reproche pas la destruction aux Musulmans: Emanuel Chrysoloras dit qu’il n’y avait de son tems (+1415) plus guère que des fragmens et des bases des statues.</p>
    <p>Au reste tout notre Occident est prodigieusement attentif aux symptômes de défaillance que donne le colosse naguère menaçant de la révolution française; peu de voix, fortement poussées, mais peu répétées, s’élèvent encore aujhui en son faveur; il semble que le honte, et le chagrin de s’être trop prononcé, impose le silence à la plupart de nos énergumènes allemands et que même la scholastique de Kant, qui paraissait s’associer à la métaphysique des Français, se ressent du changement. Bien des suffrages se prononcent, non sans effet, contre cette dernière: le livre de Herder fait beaucoup d’impression: les satyres de Wieland, et l’humour de Nicolai, des journaux anglais, et plus que toute autre chose, l’extravagance avec laquelle Fichte et d’autres se sont énoncés, ramène bep d’hoes à la saine raison; si bien que j’espère voir naître le bien de l’excès de si grands maux, et les hoes retourner au système simple et honnête de se procurer chacun son genre de félicité sans troubler le monde pour sa phraséologie politico-métaphysique.</p>
    <p>Je Vous prie de remercier beaucoup M. l’internonce de ce qu’il a bien voulu Vous dire d’obligeant par rapport à moi; Vous connaissez les sentimens avec lesquels je Vous ai toujours parlé de lui et de ses travaux politiques que j’ai pu voir. Assurément je prendrai pour moi la majeure partie de la reconnaissance que Vous lui devrez pour ce qu’il fera en Votre faveur et celle de vos études; et je serai bien charmé de toute occasion pour lui prouver mon dévouement.</p>
    <p>Le major Ouseley a publié deux cahiers (que nous n’avons pas encore) d’un journal oriental; dans un des mém y contenus il tâche de faire voir que les monumens de Tschilminar ont leur clef dans Firdausi, càd qu’ils représentent des actions dont Firdausi fait l’hist. Ils lui auraient donc servi d’Archives et documens. Ouseley observe que les gens d’Istakhr connaissent cette relation entre les monumens et le poète.</p>
    <p>Un de mes amis a copié quelques lignes de la grande inscription de Djhébel et Moucattab (dans les désert de Faran); je Vous les enverrai; je soupçonne cela Phénicien. Cependant Michel (mon domestique, imaginez-Vous) en copiant cette copie, s’étant souvenu de quelques alphabets, dans Niebuhr, a effectivement trouvé quelques lettres parfaitement ressemblantes à celles du Zend. Je Vous enverrai ces charactères. Je suis à Vous de cœur et d’âme. Je me chargerai très volontiers de vos lettres, tant que je serai ici, et il n’est pas sûr encore que j’aille en Suisse.</p>
    <postscript>

RAW LLM RESPONSE:
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this TEI encoding task. First, I need to make sure I understand the user's instructions. They provided a letter from Hammer-Purgstall to someone, and they want it encoded in TEI XML according to specific rules. The key points are to maintain original spelling, structure, and not abbreviate anything. Also, the salutation and address have exceptions, but the user said to exclude those from the encoding, so I need to focus on the rest.

Starting with the structure. The root should be <body> with a <div type="letter"> for the main content. The address is in a separate <div type="address">, but the user mentioned that the address rule is an exception. Wait, the user said to encode all structural letter blocks except salutation and address. So maybe the address part at the end is not to be encoded? Let me check the original query again.

The user said: "Analyze the letter structure and encode all structural letter blocks with appropriate and valid TEI markup (except the salutation and the address rule)". So the address part at the end is not to be encoded. But the example provided by the user includes an address. Wait, looking back, the user's example might have included the address as a separate <div type="address">, but the current task says to exclude the address. Hmm, need to be careful here.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "except the salutation and the address rule". So the salutation and address are excluded from the encoding. So the actual letter content, including the body, dateline, signature, etc., should be encoded, but the address at the end (the part starting with "An Seine...") is excluded. So the address part is not part of the letter, but the user's example might have included it. Wait, the user's example might have included the address as a separate element, but according to the task, we should not encode the address. Let me check the original letter again.

Looking at the provided letter, the address is at the very end, starting with "An Seine...". The user's instruction says to exclude the salutation and address. So I should not encode that part. So the main letter content is from the first line to "Wien am 21ten December 1853." and then the address is omitted.

Next, the document structure: the main letter is inside a <div type="letter">. The body includes the dateline, salutation, content, signature, postscript. Wait, but the user said to exclude the salutation. Wait, the exception was that p elements can contain salute when it's embedded. But according to the task, we need to encode all structural blocks except salutation and address. So the salutation is not to be encoded. Wait, the user said "except the salutation and the address rule". So the salutation and address are not to be encoded. So the salutation part (like "Gnädiger Herr!") is not included in the encoding? But that seems odd. Wait, the user's encoding rules mention that p elements may contain salute when embedded in a paragraph, but according to the task, we are to exclude the salutation. So perhaps the salutation is not to be encoded, and the address is also excluded. So the salutation and address parts are omitted from the XML.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "Review the provided encoding rules. Analyze the letter structure and encode all structural letter blocks with appropriate and valid TEI markup (except the salutation and the address rule)". So the salutation and address are excluded. Therefore, the salutation "Gnädiger Herr!" is not encoded. Also, the address at the end is not encoded.

So the main elements to encode are the dateline, the body of the letter, the signature, and any postscript. Let's check the original text.

The letter starts with "Hochgeborner Graf..." which is the address, but according to the user's instruction, that's excluded. Then "Gnädiger Herr!" is the salutation, which is also excluded. The next part is the body of the letter, which includes the response to the letter, the explanation, the request for the thanks, etc. Then the signature is "Hammer-Purgstall" and the dateline "Wien am 21ten December 1853." The address is the part starting with "An Seine...".

So the structure would be:

- <body>
  - <div type="letter">
    - <dateline>Wien am 21ten December 1853.</dateline>
    - <p>...the body of the letter...</p>
    - <p>...signature and closing...</p>
  - </div>
  - <div type="address">...</div> (but this is excluded per user's instruction)
- </body>

Wait, but the user said to exclude the address, so the <div type="address"> is not included. Also, the salutation is not encoded. So the salutation "Gnädiger Herr!" is not in the XML. The dateline is included as a <dateline> element. The body is in <p> elements, maintaining original paragraphing. The signature is part of the last paragraph.

I need to make sure that the original paragraphs are preserved. The user's rule says to maintain original paragraph sectioning, only marking new line beginnings in salutations. But since the salutation is excluded, the line breaks in the body should be preserved as <p> elements. Each paragraph in the original text should be a <p> element.

Also, the user mentioned that the address is not to be encoded. So the part starting with "An Seine..." is omitted. So the final XML should include the dateline, the body paragraphs, and the signature, but not the address or salutation.

Another thing: the user said to use <div type="letter"> for the main content, which includes dateline, salutation, content, signature, postscript. But since salutation is excluded, it's not included. The <dateline> is inside the <div type="letter">.

Also, the <div type="letter"> should contain the content, and the <dateline> is part of that.

So putting it all together, the XML would start with <body>, then a <div type="letter"> containing the <dateline> and the body paragraphs, and the signature. The address is excluded.

Now, checking for any other elements. The user's example might have used <p> for paragraphs, <dateline>, and the signature as part of a <p> element. The closing formula is part of the last paragraph.

I need to ensure that the original text is fully represented without abbreviation. Also, maintain original spelling, like "Wien am 21ten December 1853." with "21ten" instead of "21. ten" or similar.

So the final XML would look like:

<body>
  <div type="letter">
    <dateline>Wien am 21ten December 1853.</dateline>
    <p>Ich beantworte das verehrte Schreiben Euerer Exzellenz, welches mit der Beilage des Notifikationsschreibens des verliehenen Kommandeurs des Leopold-Ordens und Dekoration desselben ich gestern zu erhalten die Ehre gehabt.</p>
    <p>Euere Exzellenz sind durch mich und durch S E den Herrn Minister des Inneren unterrichtet, daß ich im Sommer des Jahres 1850 von der Ministerkonferenz einstimmig zur geheimen Ratswürde in Antrag gebracht worden bin; im Oktober des darauf folgenden Jahres fragte ich deshalb bei meinem Chef und beim Herrn Minister des Inneren an, dieser fragte mich, ob mich denn das Kommandeurkreuz des Leopold-Ordens nicht freuen würde; ich antwortete, daß es mich schon deshalb nicht freuen könne, weil das mir schon von Weiland Sr M Kaiser Franz durch den Mund meines damaligen Chefs Sr D des Hrn F v Metternich versprochene, da dieser darüber keinen Vortrag erstattet hatte, zu unangenehmen Erläuterungen Anlaß gab, die mir viel Verdruß gemacht. I KK H die Herren Erzherzöge Franz Karl und Ludwig sind in voller Kenntnis der Sache. Der Herr Minister des Inneren stellte hierauf dieselbe Frage in Betreff des Kommandeurs der eiserenen Krone, und ich antwortete, daß, da bei der Ministerkonferenz ohnedies bemerkt worden sei, daß ich der Orden genug hätte, mich keiner mehr freuen könne. Im Nachhausegehen fiel mir ein, daß die Nichternennung zum geheimen Rate vielleicht nur in einem neu aufgestellten Prinzipe liege, daß auch die größten wissenschaftlichen Verdienste zu keinem Anspruche auf den geheimen Ratstitel berechtigen und schrieb sogleich an den Herrn Minister des Inneren, daß, wenn meine Voraussetzung richtig sei, ich mir um so mehr alle Kommandeurkreuze verbitten müßte.</p>
    <p>Es kann mich also auch heute das Kommandeurkreuz des Leopold-Ordens nicht nur aus den obigen Gründen, sondern auch deshalb nicht freuen, weil Hr v Humboldt, der mit mir zugleich vom Könige Louis Philippe zum Offizier der Ehrenlegion ernennet worden, gerade vor einem Jahre von Sr M dem Kaiser die Anerkennung seines literarischen Verdienstes durch das Großkreuz des Franz Josephs-Ordens erhalten hat.</p>
    <p>Wiewohl mich also dieses Kommandeurkreuz nicht im geringsten freuen kann, so bitte ich doch pflichtgemäß Euere Exzellenz, dafür meinen alleruntertänigsten Dank Seiner Majestät zu Füßen zu legen.</p>
    <p>Übrigens halte ich es nach dem gnädigen Schreiben Euerer Exzellenz für meine Pflicht, mich zur Säkularfeier der k.k. orientalischen Akademie mit Wort und Schrift zu betätigen, und verharre in tiefster Ehrfurcht und Unterwürfigkeit Euerer Exzellenz gehorsamster untertänigster</p>
    <p>Hammer-Purgstall</p>
  </div>
</body>

Wait, but the last paragraph has "Hammer-Purgstall" as the signature. But the original text has "Hammer-Purgstall" followed by the dateline. Wait, the original text has the dateline before the signature. Let me check again.

Original text:

"Hammer-Purgstall
Wien am 21ten December 1853."

So the dateline is "Wien am 21ten December 1853." and the signature is "Hammer-Purgstall" on the line above. In TEI, the <dateline> is typically placed at the beginning of the letter, but in this case, the dateline is written after the signature. That might be a formatting issue. However, according to the user's rules, the dateline is part of the <div type="letter">. But the original structure has the signature first, then the dateline. That's unusual. Maybe the user made a mistake in the original text, or it's a historical format. But according to the rules, I have to preserve the original structure. So the dateline is after the signature in the original text. However, in standard TEI, the <dateline> is usually at the beginning. But the user's instruction says to preserve the original structure. So I need to encode the dateline as it appears in the original, even if it's after the signature. But that's not standard. Wait, looking at the original text again:

The letter ends with:

"verharre in tiefster Ehrfurcht und Unterwürfigkeit Euerer Exzellenz gehorsamster untertänigster

Hammer-Purgstall
Wien am 21ten December 1853."

So the signature is "Hammer-Purgstall" on a line by itself, followed by the dateline on the next line. In the original, the dateline is after the signature. So in the XML, the <dateline> should be placed where it is in the original text, which is after the signature. However, in standard TEI, the <dateline> is part of the header, but the user's instruction says to include it within the <div type="letter">. So the structure would be:

<div type="letter">
  <p>...</p>
  <p>Hammer-Purgstall</p>
  <dateline>Wien am 21ten December 1853.</dateline>
</div>

But that's not standard, but the user's instruction says to preserve the original structure. Therefore, the dateline is placed after the signature in the XML. However, in the original text, the dateline is on a separate line after the signature. So in the XML, the <dateline> element should be placed after the signature paragraph.

Wait, but the <dateline> is a separate element, not part of a <p>. So the structure would be:

<div type="letter">
  <p>...</p>
  <p>Hammer-Purgstall</p>
  <dateline>Wien am 21ten December 1853.</dateline>
</div>

But in the original text, the dateline is on the line after the signature. So the user's instruction says to maintain original paragraph sectioning, but the <dateline> is a separate element. So perhaps the <dateline> is placed after the signature paragraph. That's how it is in the original.

Therefore, the final XML would have the <dateline> after the signature paragraph. But in TEI, the <dateline> is usually in the header, but according to the user's rules, the <div type="letter"> includes the dateline. So the structure is correct as per the user's instructions.

Another thing to check: the user's example might have used <p> for the signature. In the original, the signature is on a line by itself. So in the XML, it's a <p> with "Hammer-Purgstall" as the content. The <dateline> is then placed after that.

So the final XML should have the <dateline> element after the signature paragraph. That's how the original is structured, so it's correct to encode it that way, even if it's non-standard.

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this encoding task. The user wants me to convert a letter from Beethoven into TEI XML, following specific rules. First, I need to recall the encoding guidelines provided.

The main structure starts with a <body> element containing a <div type="letter">. Inside that, there's the dateline, salutation, body text, signature, and postscript. However, the user mentioned that the salutation and address rules are exceptions, so I need to be careful with those. Wait, the user said to encode all structural blocks except salutation and address, but the example might still need those. Let me check the rules again.

The general rules say to maintain original structure, paragraphs, and not abbreviate. Also, preserve original spelling and orthography. The document sectioning starts with <body> and uses <div type="letter"> for the main content. The address is in a separate <div type="address">, but the user said to exclude salutation and address from the encoding. Wait, no—the user's instruction says to encode all structural blocks except the salutation and address. Wait, the original task says: "encode all structural letter blocks with appropriate and valid TEI markup (except the salutation and the address rule)". So I don't need to encode the salutation and address. But looking at the letter provided, there's a salutation at the beginning and a signature at the end. Wait, the example given in the user's message includes the salutation and the signature. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the exception. Let me recheck the encoding rules.

The user wrote: "Exception from TEI valid encoding: 1. Contrary to the standard TEI content model, p elements may contain a salute element when the salutation is embedded within a paragraph and not visually set off as a separate block. 2. Contrary to the standard TEI content model, div elements may contain a address element without being nested in an ab element."

Wait, but the task says to encode all structural blocks except salutation and address. Maybe the user meant that the salutation and address are not to be encoded with their standard TEI elements, but instead handled according to the exceptions? Or perhaps the user wants to exclude them from the encoding? That's confusing. Let me look at the example provided by the user. The sample letter starts with "Verzeihen Sie..." which is the body, but the salutation is not present here. Wait, the letter the user provided doesn't have a salutation. The first line is "Verzeihen Sie, mein werter H," which might be the salutation. But the user's instruction says to exclude the salutation and address. Wait, but the user's example might not have a salutation. Let me check again.

The letter given starts with "Verzeihen Sie, mein werter H," which is the salutation. The user's encoding rules mention that salutations are exceptions. So perhaps in the TEI encoding, the salutation is not marked with a <salute> element, but instead left as a regular paragraph. But the user's rule 1 says that p elements can contain a salute when embedded in a paragraph. However, the task says to exclude the salutation and address from the encoding. Wait, the user's instruction says: "encode all structural letter blocks with appropriate and valid TEI markup (except the salutation and the address rule)". So perhaps the salutation and address are not to be encoded with their own elements, but left as regular text. But that's conflicting with the TEI standard. Maybe the user wants to encode the rest of the letter structure, but not the salutation and address. However, the example given by the user includes the salutation as part of the body. Let me proceed carefully.

Assuming that the salutation is part of the body and not marked as a separate element, I'll include it in the <p> elements. The address is not present in this letter, so that's not an issue. The main parts to encode are the dateline, body text, signature, and postscript. Wait, the letter provided doesn't have a dateline. The first line is the salutation, then the body, then the signature. So the structure would be: <div type="letter"> containing the salutation (as part of a <p>), the body paragraphs, the signature, and any postscript. The signature is "Ludwig van Beethoven" at the end. The user's example might have a signature, so I need to mark that. The postscript is not present here.

So the structure would be:

<body>
  <div type="letter">
    <p>Verzeihen Sie, mein werter H... (the salutation and first paragraph)</p>
    <p>... (second paragraph about Stoll)</p>
    <p>... (third paragraph about going to the countryside and signature)</p>
    <div type="address"> (if there was an address, but there isn't one here)</div>
  </div>
</body>

But since the user says to exclude salutation and address, but the example includes the salutation as part of the <p>, I'll proceed with that. Also, the original text has the salutation as the first line, which is part of the body. The signature is at the end, so I'll mark that with a <signed> element inside the <div type="letter">.

Wait, according to TEI, the signature is usually in a <signed> element. The user's instruction says to encode all structural blocks except salutation and address. So the salutation is not marked with a <salute> element, but the signature is marked with <signed>. The address is not present here, so no need for that.

So the final XML would have the body with the letter div, containing paragraphs, and the signed element. Let me structure that now.
</think>

<body>
  <div type="letter">
    <p>Verzeihen Sie, mein werter H, indem ich Ihnen noch nicht den Brief nach Paris gebracht: eben jetzt überhäuft mit so mancherlei, konnte ich das Schreiben dahin nur von einem Tage auf den andern aufschieben. Morgen unterdessen erhalten Sie den Brief, wenn es mir auch nicht möglich sein sollte, Sie selbst, was ich mir so sehr wünschte, besuchen zu können.</p>
    <p>Noch eine andere Gelegenheit möchte ich Ihnen ans Herz legen, vielleicht wäre es möglich, daß Sie für einen armen unglücklichen, nämlich für den Herrn Stoll, Sohn des berühmten Arztes, wirken könnten. Es ist wohl bei manchem anderen Menschen die Rede, wie einer unglücklich geworden durch eigne oder fremde Schuld, das wird jedoch nicht der Fall bei Ihnen und bei mir sein; genug, der Stoll ist unglücklich, sieht sein einziges Heil in einer Reise nach Paris, weil er voriges Jahr wichtige Bekanntschaften gemacht hat, die ihn dazu führen werden, von dort aus eine Professur in Westphalen zu erhalten: Stoll hat deswegen mit einem Herrn von Neumann, der bei der Staatskanzlei ist, gesprochen, um mit einem Courier nach Paris fortzukommen, aber der Courier wollte ihn nicht anders, als für eine Summe von 25 Louis d'or mitnehmen. Nun frage ich Sie, mein Lieber, ob Sie nicht mit diesem Herrn von Neumann reden wollten, daß dieser es möglich mache, daß ein solcher Courier den Stoll unentgeltlich oder doch nur für eine ganz geringe Summe mitnehme. Indem ich Sie von dieser Sache unterrichte, bin ich überzeugt, daß Sie gern, wenn Sie sonst nichts hindert, sich für den armen Stoll verwenden werden.</p>
    <p>Ich gehe heute wieder aufs Land, doch hoffe ich, bald so glücklich zu sein, einmal eine Stunde in Ihrer Gesellschaft zubringen zu können. Bis dahin empfehle ich mich Ihnen und wünsche, daß Sie sich überzeugt halten von der Achtung Ihres ergebensten Dieners</p>
