    <p>The opportunity offered me by the voyage of a friend Mr Robert Wilson to Malta and his probable passage through Vienna on his return to England promises with the most favourable one I could procure of continuing at this distant interval the correspondence with Vienna which it is the desire of every friend to oriental literature in Calcutta to maintain – you will, I hope, have received the parcels sent you from this sometime or from years ago and which I was sorry to find by your letter to my friend Captain Lockett had got no farther than Trieste after having been so long dispatched. You will probably also have received by this time the twelfth volume of the <salute>Asiatic Researches</salute> which Mr Colebrooke at present acting as agent to the Society in London has been directed to forward to your address. I hope soon to have the thirteenth volume to send to you by the same channel. We have received your books and are obliged to you for such proofs of your regard. The <salute>Mines of the East</salute> seem to be the depositaries of much oriental wealth and must be highly serviceable to the cultivation of Asiatic literature. I apprehend some error has been made in their assortment however as the numbers received from three volumes compleat whilst we want two numbers of the fourth which are deficient. The <salute>Asiatic Researches</salute> and statistical account of the Ottoman Empire has come safe and sound. <p>I have little news to give to you. Oriental study is rather languishing amongst us and we stand in need of some spur as the emulation which your labours and those of esteemed scholars excite. The Persian Dictionary, <salute>Burhan Katā</salute> dictionary edited by Captain Roebuck.
